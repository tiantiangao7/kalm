# Knowledge Authoring Logic Machine (KALM)
Authors: Tiantian Gao, Paul Fodor, Michael Kifer

# Introduction
The KALM system allows knowledge authoring with the aim of endowing domain experts with tools that would allow them to translate their knowledge into logic by means of a Controlled Natural Language (CNL). We also develop the query service to support question answering based on the authored knowledge. The features of KALM are five-fold:
* A formal, FrameNet-inspired ontology FrameOnt that formalizes FrameNet frames and integrates linguistic resources from BabelNet to represent the meaning of English sentences.
* An incrementally-learned semantic parser that disambiguates CNL sentences by mapping semantically equivalent sentences into the same FrameOnt frames and assigns them unique logical representation (ULR). 
* Explainability: the approach makes it possible to explain both why particular meanings are assigned and also why mistakes were made.
* A hybrid CNL-based language for authoring queries.
* Both knowledge authoring and question answering parts achieve superior accuracy.

# Dependencies
1. Java JRE 1.8 (https://www.java.com/en/download/)
2. XSB Prolog Version 3.7 (http://xsb.sourceforge.net/)
3. XSB Prolog version of Attempto Parsing Engine (APE) under LGPL licence (included in this repository)
4. APE Clex under GPL licence (http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/downloads/files/) (included in this repository)
5. BabelNet 3.7.1 Java API. (http://babelnet.org/download)
6. BabelNet 3.7 indices (http://babelnet.org/download)

# Installation
1. BabelNet 3.7 indices. User must request access from http://babelnet.org/download. The license of BabelNet 3.7 indices applies.
2. XSB Prolog Version 3.7 (http://xsb.sourceforge.net/). The license of XSB Prolog is GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2).

# Code
* `src/` Java source code for UI, semantic score computation, meta data deserialization for frame property/semantic link override/semantic score parameters/candidate parse results.
* `scripts/` XSB Prolog code for APE engine + candidate frame parses.
* `config/` BabelNet config files (please download from BabelNet website specified in requirement section).
* `lib/` BabelNet lib files (please download from BabelNet website specified in requirement section).
* `resources/jlt/` BabelNet resources files (please download from BabelNet website specified in requirement section). User has to create the directory by hand.
* `resources/wnplusplus/` BabelNet resources files (please download from BabelNet website specified in requirement section). User has to create the directory by hand.
* `resources/batch/batch.txt` A collection of CNL sentences used for batch processing. The default file is the test suite for the system.
* `resources/scores/score.txt` The file containing the frame extraction results. For each sentences, it shows all of the extracted candidate parses with semantic scores, the disambiguated filler-word BabelNet synsets, and semantic paths connecting the filler word to the synset. User has to create the directory by hand. 
* `resources/frame_property/frame_property.txt` The file containing the frame descriptions.
* `resources/semantic_score_meta/` Files containing the weight bias scores, edge penalty scores, and overriden semantic links.
* `testsuite/` Test suite for frame extraction.
* `runxsb.sh` The shell script for running XSB Prolog. User must specify the installation path to XSB Prolog.
* `runbatch.sh` The shell script to process CNL sentences in batch mode.
* `start.sh` The shell script to start the KALM system, the GUI.

# Run
1. GUI: `./start.sh`
2. Bach Mode (Read sentences from file and serialize the frame extraction results into file): `./runbatch.sh`
